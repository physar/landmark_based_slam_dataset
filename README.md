# landmark_based_slam_dataset

Most of the recent SLAM datasets directly start with many observations and many features to recognize in each observation. Yet, it all started with observing a few landmarks in a few observations.

A good example is the Gutmann dataset [1], which used an Aibo robot walking a trajectory between 5 points, observing 6 landmarks on the corner of a soccer field. This experiment was later the origin of the RoboCup 4-Legged league SLAM challenge in 2004 and 2005.
This dataset is a recreation of these experiments, but now with a Nao robot, on a much larger Standard Platform League soccer field.
